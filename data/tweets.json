This is an interesting encapsulation of slogans of all American Presidents 
US is going to  polls on Nov 3rd Tuesday..  Who will win the Presidency? 
I wish joe Biden to claim victory  to US. 
It Is NOT Almost Over US Elections 2020.
100 hours to go for poll in US ..... Donald Trump is still favourable to India as compared to Biden ...Biden is leading a way long ...New journey, new relations to be started ....Hoping for the best.
Am I reading this correct in saying the most frequently occurring outcome in these simulation models is ~410 votes for Biden? 
That's the true identity of Americans; if you prefer softer/diplomatic replies, vote JoeBiden.
I still have the feeling Trump's gonna win this 
I have cast my vote God bless  America a land of Opportunities for all.
God help America indeed. 
Gotta go buy some bear for the election night! 
When Court granted bail to Steve Bannon recently did they realise Bannon is most probably a HOBO? 
As simple as that.
My support is to KamalaHarris  and JoeBiden even though i like Donald Trump ...
Let the best man win ...
If the US Elections 2020 is still divided almost by half, then the US deserves  real DonaldTrump
Not saying I'm a massive fan, but Trump2020 will win.
Really Powerful leader. VOTE BidenHarris.
JoeBiden Shows his physical fitness with short runs while climbing on podiums. 
Gonna be an interesting week for the markets!

  And watch where the chalk white arrows go To the place where the sidewalk ends
  Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow
  Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black And the dark street winds and bends
  And there the moon bird rests from his flight To cool in the peppermint wind
  And there the grass grows soft and white And there the sun burns crimson bright
  There is a place where the sidewalk ends And before the street begins
